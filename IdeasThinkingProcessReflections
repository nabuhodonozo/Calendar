Just storing my thoughts, notes, ideas etc.

I need to differentiate SkipButtons. One should be backward another forward. Should I separate SkipButton class to LeftSkipButton and RightSkipButton?
(This ll be easy, but I ll have duplicate code, cuz only difference is "img/text/arrow direction" and whether add or subtract days.)
(Or make something like abstract class or interface with common logic)
Or make enum inside SkipButton and pass it to constructor. And each time I ll make new button I ll decide which one I want to make.
(Both button logic ll be in the same place which means no duplicate code, but kinda messy inside one class)


Q: I need to somehow store date;
S1: static DatePicker contains chosen date. And all components can take date from it for eg. SkipButtons
(Require datePicker being static which is bad)
S2: Declare everything in Main and get to every element via Main.element.element...
S3: In main pass some elements as arguments in constructor.

S1: ShouldI have 2 jpanels (week/month) one of them active the other one invisible.
(They both ll receive events and react to them, kinda cool in small app, but in long term inactive elements are consuming resources)
S2: Each time I switch viewType textFields are either deleted or added.
(Kinda cool, but maybe it's easier to store both of them in memory rather than draw them each time)

If I chose to have those 2 jpanels. Should they both implement interfaces extend abstract class or make something like controller for them with common logic. Just loading required class with proper grid layout and number of TextFields.
(When I made 1 controller for Views and it Jpanel either Week or Month it requires making them static, otherwise it wont work as planed)
(Maybe abstract class would be better solution)
